It parses and analyzes the social network of an online community. It visualizes the graph using the Vivagraph graphics library and provides centrality values for the community members.\r\n\r\n### Motivation (i.e. why this thing exists)\r\nThis tool allows near real-time analysis and visualization of online social environments. We propose that with automated methods an instructor can better evaluate the evolving social dynamics of an online classroom and intervene if necessary. In our design, we have two major approaches: The analysis of the social network using mathematical methods, which is based on existing research on SNA, and the design of an automated analysis and visualization tool. In this tool we combine both of these approaches into one fully automated workflow that downloads, processes and visualizes the SNA results.\r\n\r\n## Science!\r\nYou can see our previous publications about learning and gamification at our [publication list](http://www.codecamp.fi/doku.php/wiki/educational_technologies_centre).\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\nThere is a data parser plugin available for the [Q2A](http://www.question2answer.org/) forum.\r\n\r\n## Usage instructions\r\nSet up a cron job to analyze logfiles from a desired source using an input plugin and copy the JSON results into a suitable directory. Use .htaccess or equivalent to control access to the data source and the page itself.\r\n\r\n## Libraries and licenses\r\nThe web app uses the Vivagraph.JS ([LICENSE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS/master/LICENSE)), jQuery, ([LICENSE](https://jquery.org/license/)) and D3 ([LICENSE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbostock/d3/master/LICENSE)) libraries.
